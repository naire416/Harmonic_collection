         <p>Sea angels (clade Gymnosomata) are a large group of small free-swimming <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_slug">sea slugs</a>, not to be confused with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cnidaria">Cnidarians</a> (Jellyfish and other similar creatures), classified into six different families. They are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelagic">pelagic</a> opisthobranchs in the clade Gymnosomata within the larger mollusc clade Heterobranchia. Sea angels were previously referred to as a type of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pteropod">pteropod</a>.</p>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <hr>
         <p>In this clade, the foot of the gastropod has developed into wing-like flapping appendages (parapodia) and larval sea angels discard their embryonic shells a few days after hatching. Both adaptations suit their free-swimming oceanic lives. The adaptations also explain the common name sea angel and the scientific name of the order: From Greek gymnos meaning "naked" and soma meaning "body".</p>
    <h2>Wings Anatomy</h2>

    <p>The wing comprises seven groups of muscles, anterior oblique muscles for dorsal and ventral sides, posterior oblique muscles for dorsal and ventral sides, the longitudinal and transverse wing retractors muscles, and dorso-ventral muscles. The first four groups form a continuous sheet where the dorsal muscles are perpendicular to the ventral muscles. Transverse and longitudinal retractors muscles retract the wing along the span and the chord. The dorso-ventral muscles control the thickness of the wing by changing the haemocoelic pressure inside the wing, this also ejects the buccal apparatus from C. limacinaâ€™s head</p>
